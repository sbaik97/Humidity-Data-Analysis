# Humidity-Data-Analysis
Using matplotlib, graphs were plotted in python using matplotlib to demonstrate the trends of Relative humidity % (RH%) over time, RH sensor temperature over time, and dewpoint temperature over time using data from a csv file. 

# RH% 
![RH_change_over_time](Humidity_Analysis_Graphs/RH%25_change_over_time.png)  
Graph showing the the changes in RH% over time with data obtained from csv file. 

# RH Sensor Temperature 
![RH_Sensor_Temperature(c)_change_over_time](/Humidity_Analysis_Graphs/RH_Sensor_Temperature(c)_change_over_time.png)  
Graph showing the changes in RH% over time with data obtained from csv file. 

# Dewpoint
![Dewpoint_temperature_(c)_change_overtime](/Humidity_Analysis_Graphs/Dewpoint_temperature_(c)_change_overtime.png)  
Graph showing the changes in dewpoint temperature over time. The dewpoint was calculated based on RH% and RH Sensor Temperature data.

# Saturated Water Vapor
![Saturated_Water_Pressure_change_overtime](/Humididty_Analysis_Graphs/Saturated_Water_Pressure_change_overtime.png)  
Graph showing the changes in saturated water vapor pressure over time. Saturated water vapor pressure was calculated with RH% and RH Sensor Temperature data.

# Water Vapor Pressure
![Water_Vapor_Pressure_change_overtime](/Humididty_Analysis_Graphs/Water_Vapor_Pressure_change_overtime.png)  
Graph showing the changes in water vapor pressure over time. Water vapore pressure was calculated in python with saturated water vapor pressure that was previously obtained. 

# Absolute Humidity
![Water_Vapor_Pressure_change_overtime](/Humidity_Analysis_Graphs/Water_Vapor_Pressure_change_overtime.png)  
Graph showing the the changes in absolute humidity over time. Absolute Humidity was calculated in python with the water vapor pressure that was previously obtained.
